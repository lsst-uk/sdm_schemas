Added tap:table_index values for ConsDB schemas.
Exposure and related tables come first (100 series), followed by visit tables (200 series).
Per-CCD versions of the above follow (300 and 400 series).
Last are the flexible metadata schemas that are currently unused (and may not ever become public, if they are used; 800 and 900 series).
