Convert DIA timestamp fields to MJD TAI and rename them.

This changes `DiaSource` and `DiaForcedSource.time_processed` and `time_withdrawn` to `timeProcessedMjdTai` and `timeWithdrawnMjdTai`.
`DiaSource.ssObjectReassocTime` becomes `ssObjectReassocTimeMjdTai`.
Similarly, `DIAObject.validityStart` and `validityEnd` become `validityStartMjdTai` and `validityEndMjdTai`.
