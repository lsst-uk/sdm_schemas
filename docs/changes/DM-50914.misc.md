Added ``--force-unbounded-arraysize`` to ``tap-schema/build`` for forcing VOTable arraysize to '*' on columns by default for variable length string types.
This change affects the arraysize values in the TAP_SCHEMA SQL output that is generated for the Docker images.
This is a temporary workaround for [astropy Issue #18099](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/18099), which will eventually be reverted once there is a permanent fix.
